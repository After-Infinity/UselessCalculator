## Project Description 
this is simply just a usless calculator that is soo slow and make hilarious calculations but will give the correct answer 

## The Problem (that doesn't exist) 
Regular calculators are too efficient and boring. They just give you the answer without any drama or entertainment, making mathematics a dull experience.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for) 
Our Useless Calculator adds unnecessary complexity, random delays, fake crashes, and entertaining animations to simple calculations. It turns basic math into an adventure!

## Technical Details

### For Software: 

#### Screenshots 
![Calculator Interface](screenshots/calculator_interface.svg)  
The deceptively simple interface hides the chaos that awaits the user.

![Blue Screen Crash](screenshots/blue_screen.svg)  
When entering a 5-digit number, the calculator simulates a Windows blue screen crash.

![THAMBURAN API](screenshots/thamburan_api.svg)  
For 3-digit calculations, the calculator connects to a fictional "THAMBURAN API" for divine mathematical assistance.

#### Diagrams

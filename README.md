# Useless Calculator ðŸŽ¯ 

## Basic Details 
**Team Name:** Calculator Chaos

## Team Members 
- **Team Lead:** Jane Doe - MIT 
- **Member 2:** John Smith - Stanford 
- **Member 3:** Alex Johnson - CalTech 

## Project Description 
A deliberately over-engineered calculator that makes simple calculations unnecessarily complex and entertaining. It performs basic math operations with dramatic flair and unexpected twists.

## The Problem (that doesn't exist) 
Regular calculators are too efficient and boring. They just give you the answer without any drama or entertainment, making mathematics a dull experience.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for) 
Our Useless Calculator adds unnecessary complexity, random delays, fake crashes, and entertaining animations to simple calculations. It turns basic math into an adventure!

## Technical Details 

### Technologies/Components Used 

#### For Software: 
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
- **Frameworks:** None (pure vanilla JS for maximum chaos) 
- **Libraries:** None (we wrote everything from scratch to ensure maximum inefficiency) 
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Chrome DevTools 

### Implementation 

#### For Software: 

##### Installation 
```
git clone https://github.com/calculator-chaos/useless-calculator.git
cd useless-calculator
```

##### Run 
```
Open index.html in your browser
```

## Project Documentation 

### For Software: 

#### Screenshots 
![Calculator Interface](screenshots/calculator_interface.svg)  
The deceptively simple interface hides the chaos that awaits the user.

![Blue Screen Crash](screenshots/blue_screen.svg)  
When entering a 5-digit number, the calculator simulates a Windows blue screen crash.

![THAMBURAN API](screenshots/thamburan_api.svg)  
For 3-digit calculations, the calculator connects to a fictional "THAMBURAN API" for divine mathematical assistance.

#### Diagrams

This diagram shows the unnecessarily complex workflow of a simple calculation, including all the pointless detours and delays.

## Team Contributions 
**Jane Doe:** Designed the chaotic calculation algorithms and implemented the fake crash screens.

**John Smith:** Created the THAMBURAN API terminal simulation and the progress bar animations.

**Alex Johnson:** Implemented the keyboard input functionality and designed the user interface.
